L0 controller consumes 1 descriptor per transaction with the following fields:

  * command
    * code   - [8]
    * width  - [2] 0/1/2/4-bit (encoded: 0/1/2/3)
  * address
    * width  - [2] 0/1/2/4-bit (encoded: 0/1/2/3)
    * length - [16] number of payload bytes (0..0xFFFF)
    * DTR    - [1] STR/DTR (0/1)
  * request
    * width  - [2] 0/1/2/4-bit (encoded: 0/1/2/3)
    * length - [16] number of payload bytes (0..0xFFFF)
    * DTR    - [1] STR/DTR (0/1)
  * dummy
    * length - [8] (0..255) number of dummy cycles after the request
  * response
    * width  - [2] 0/1/2/4-bit (encoded: 0/1/2/3)
    * length - [16] number of payload bytes (0..0xFFFF)
    * DTR    - [1] STR/DTR (0/1)
